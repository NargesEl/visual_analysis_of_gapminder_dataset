# visual_analysis_of_gapminder_dataset

For this bootcamp projcet I created a animated scatterplot for the [Gapminder Dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). 

I used pandas and matplotlib to create a scatterplot and created a gif that visualised the correlation between life expectancy and fertility in selected countries from 1960 to 2015.
